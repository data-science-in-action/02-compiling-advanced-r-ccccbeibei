During the building process, I've met several problems.Next I will list my efforts and my problems.

## Efforts
1.In order to compile Advanced R into a PDF, I installed the Texlive and Rmarkdown packages  before compiling (Note: added a path in the system settings).

2.upgrade RStudio and installed packages to the latest version.

3.Download the missing package. The packages I installed during the process are *bookdown*, *htmltools*, *caTools*, *bitops*, *rmarkdown*, *dplyr*, *tinytex*, etc. Use `install.packages()` to solve this kind of problem.

4.Download MiKTeX and Texmaker. I failed when configuring the environment. Later I found out that the reason was that I could not connect to the server outside the country.

5.Download texlive2019.iso and TeXstudio. Then I can compile the PDF version.


## Problems&Solutions

### Unable to load devtools package


```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("devtools")

```

### Failed to install "emo" from Github:

```{r fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/dell/Desktop/adv-r/error/2.PNG")

```



To solve this problem,I executed the following command in Git.

```{r eval=FALSE}

$ git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl"

$ git config --global http.sslCAInfo E:/R/R-3.6.1/library/openssl/cacert.pem 

```

### Quitting from lines 223-235(Introduction.Rmd)



Adding'encoding = "UTF-8"' in line 224 can fix it.

```{r eval=FALSE}

contributors <- read.csv("contributors.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE,encoding = "UTF-8")

```



### Quitting from lines 233-234(Perf-measure.Rmd)



```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("ggbeeswarm")

```



### 'make' not found

Quitting from lines 77-84(Rcpp.Rmd)



I added `C:\Rtools\bin\` to the path of the environment variable of the computer system, but the error still occurred, so I reinstalled `Rtools` and successfully solved this problem.



### Font

I downloaded the font 'andalemono'and'inconsolata'from the internet and install.


After solving these problems, the book was successfully built.
